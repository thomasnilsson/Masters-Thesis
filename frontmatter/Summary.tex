\chapter{Summary}
Mobility features derived from location data can be used to describe behaviour changes in people suffering from depression-related diseases. Existing contributions dealing with the computation of mobility features are cumbersome to reproduce due to a lack of publicly available source code. Furthermore, the algorithms provided have not been considered for real-time computation on a smart-phone. This means they cannot necessarily be used 'in the field' which is when features can support psychotherapeutic interventions. These two research problems were addressed in this thesis, by implementing the Mobility Features Package - a software package for the Flutter framework. With the package, an application programmer is able to compute mobility features with just 3 lines of code. Furthermore the package allows the application programmer to flexibly choose their own Flutter plugin for tracking location data to avoid dependency issues with other plugins. This opens the possibility for researchers to easily include mobility features in their mHealth applications.\\

A field study was conducted with 10 participants in which their location was tracked via an iOS application over 3 weeks. This application also used the Mobility Features Pacakge to compute features several times a day. Participants filled out a daily questionnaire pertaining to 3 of the computed features, and these answers were afterwards compared to features computed during the study. In comparing the daily location features with subjective user data we found that the Mobility Features Package predicts the Number of Places visited with an RMSE of 0.5 places, the Home Stay percentage with an RMSE of 14.3\% and the Routine Index with an RMSE of 22.5\%. However, many non-uniform gaps were observed in the collected location data which impacted the accuracy of the features. For future improvement of the package, it will be highly relevant for the algorithms to use an imputation method to handle missing data.
