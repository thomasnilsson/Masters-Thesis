\chapter{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank by supervisor Jakob Bardram for providing the initial idea for the project and for guiding me through the project with regular supervision sessions. In addition a big thanks to Jonas Busk for providing Python source code prior to starting the project, this helped the thesis a great deal in succeeding.\\

It was planned that I should write most of my thesis while psychically sitting at the chair of Information Systems (Krcmar) at the Technical University of Munich. However due to the Coronavirus outbreak in early 2020, I had to travel home to Denmark in March. However, I would like to give a big thanks to Georg Groh and Martin Lurz and Jakob Bardram for making this quasi-exchange semester possible. An additional thank you goes out to Georg Groh for introducing me to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu while I was in Munich.\\

For helping with the thesis writing I would like to thanks Darius Rohani and Marie Mørch for taking interest in reading and correcting my thesis, severely aiding the writing process and outside-reader perspectives. \\
