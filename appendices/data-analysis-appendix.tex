\section{Missing Data}

Figure \ref{fig:p8-gaps} shows the collected location data for participant P8 who had an older phone (iPhone 6s) which has limited memory and compute resources, which likely impacted how much data was tracked. The participant was very diligent in making sure the phone tracked at all times, yet substantial gaps still exist.
