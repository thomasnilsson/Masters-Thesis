title={Prevalence of Depression in the Community from 30 Countries between 1994 and 2014},

abstract={The prevalence of depression may be affected by changes in psychiatric practices and the availability of online mental health information in the past two decades. This study aimed to evaluate the aggregate prevalence of depression in communities from different countries between 1994 and 2014 and to explore the variations in prevalence stratified by geographical, methodological and socio-economic factors. A total of 90 studies were identified and met the inclusion criteria (n = 1,112,573 adults) with 68 studies on single point prevalence, 9 studies on one-year prevalence, and 13 studies on lifetime prevalence of depression. A random-effects model meta-analysis that was performed to calculate the aggregate point, one-year and lifetime prevalence of depression calculated prevalences of 12.9\%, 7.2\% and 10.8\% respectively. Point prevalence of depression was significantly higher in women (14.4\%), countries with a medium human development index (HDI) (29.2\%), studies published from 2004 to 2014 (15.4\%) and when using self-reporting instruments (17.3\%) to assess depression. Heterogeneity was identified by meta-regression and subgroup analysis, and response rate, percentage of women and year of publication, respectively, were determined contribute to depression prevalence. This meta-analysis allows benchmarking of the prevalence of depression during the era when online health information emerged, facilitating future comparisons.},

abstract={The clinical assessment of severity of depressive symptoms is commonly performed with standardized self-report questionnaires, most notably the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), which are usually administered in a clinic. These questionnaires evaluate symptoms that are stable over time. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods, on the other hand, acquire patient ratings of symptoms in the context of their lives. Today's smartphones allow us to also obtain objective contextual information, such as the GPS location, that may also be related to depression. Considering clinical PHQ-9 scores as ground truth, an interesting question is to what extent the EMA ratings and contextual sensor data can be used as potential predictors of depression. To answer this question, we obtained PHQ-9 scores from 18 participants with a variety of depressive symptoms in our lab, and then collected their EMA and GPS sensor data using their smartphones over a period of two weeks. We analyzed the relationship between GPS sensor features, EMA ratings, and the PHQ-9 scores. While we found a strong correlation between a number of sensor features extracted from the two-week period and the PHQ-9 scores, the other relationships remained non-significant. Our results suggest that depression is better evaluated using long-term sensor-based measurements than the momentary ratings of mental state or short-term sensor information.},

ABSTRACT={We present a mobile instrumentation toolkit, AWARE, an open-source effort to develop an extensible and reusable platform for capturing, inferring, and generating context on mobile devices. Mobile phones are sensor-rich but resource-constrained, and therefore several considerations need to be addressed when creating a research tool that ensures problem-free context collection. We demonstrate how AWARE can mitigate researchers’ effort when building mobile data-logging tools and context-aware applications, with minimal battery impact. By encapsulating implementation details of sensor data retrieval and exposing the sensed context as higher-level abstractions, AWARE shifts the focus from software development to data analysis, both quantitative and qualitative. We have evaluated AWARE in several case studies and discuss its use, power consumption, and scalability.}

abstract={Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating disease that is characterized by depressed mood, diminished interests, impaired cognitive function and vegetative symptoms, such as disturbed sleep or appetite. MDD occurs about twice as often in women than it does in men and affects one in six adults in their lifetime. The aetiology of MDD is multifactorial and its heritability is estimated to be approximately 35{\%}. In addition, environmental factors, such as sexual, physical or emotional abuse during childhood, are strongly associated with the risk of developing MDD. No established mechanism can explain all aspects of the disease. However, MDD is associated with alterations in regional brain volumes, particularly the hippocampus, and with functional changes in brain circuits, such as the cognitive control network and the affective--salience network. Furthermore, disturbances in the main neurobiological stress-responsive systems, including the hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal axis and the immune system, occur in MDD. Management primarily comprises psychotherapy and pharmacological treatment. For treatment-resistant patients who have not responded to several augmentation or combination treatment attempts, electroconvulsive therapy is the treatment with the best empirical evidence. In this Primer, we provide an overview of the current evidence of MDD, including its epidemiology, aetiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment.},

abstract={The data reported herein show clearly that major depression is a commonly occurring and burdensome disorder. The high prevalence, early age of onset, and high persistence of MDD in the many different countries where epidemiologic surveys have been administered confirm the high worldwide importance of depression. Although evidence is not definitive that MDD plays a causal role in its associations with the many adverse outcomes reviewed here, there is clear evidence that depression has causal effects on a number of important mediators, making it difficult to assume anything other than that depression has strong causal effects on many dimensions of burden. These results have been used to argue for the likely cost -effectiveness of expanded depression treatment from a societal perspective. Two separate, large-scale, randomized, workplace depression treatment effectiveness trials have been carried out in the United States to evaluate the cost effectiveness of expanded treatment from an employer perspective. Both trials had positive returns on investment to employers. A substantial expansion of worksite depression care management programs has occurred in the United States subsequent to the publication of these trials. However, the proportion of people with depression who receive treatment remains low in the United States and even lower in other parts of the world. A recent US study found that only about half of workers with MDD received treatment in the year of interview and that fewer than half of treated workers received treatment consistent with published treatment guidelines. Although the treatment rate was higher for more severe cases, even some with severe MDD often failed to receive treatment. The WMH surveys show that treatment rates are even lower in many other developed countries and consistently much lower in developing countries. Less information is available on rates of depression treatment among patients with chronic physical disorders, but available evidence suggests that expanded treatment could be of considerable value. Randomized, controlled trials are needed to expand our understanding of the effects of detection and treatment of depression among people in treatment for chronic physical disorders. In addition, controlled effectiveness trials with long-term follow-ups are needed to increase our understanding of the effects of early MDD treatment interventions on changes in life course role trajectories, role performance, and onset of secondary physical disorders.},

abstract={Activity scheduling is a behavioral treatment of depression in which patients learn to monitor their mood and daily activities, and how to increase the number of pleasant activities and to increase positive interactions with their environment. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized effect studies of activity scheduling. Sixteen studies with 780 subjects were included. The pooled effect size indicating the difference between intervention and control conditions at post-test was 0.87 (95{\%} CI: 0.60{\textasciitilde}1.15). This is a large effect. Heterogeneity was low in all analyses. The comparisons with other psychological treatments at post-test resulted in a non-significant pooled effect size of 0.13 in favor of activity scheduling. In ten studies activity scheduling was compared to cognitive therapy, and the pooled effect size indicating the difference between these two types of treatment was 0.02. The changes from post-test to follow-up for activity scheduling were non-significant, indicating that the benefits of the treatments were retained at follow-up. The differences between activity scheduling and cognitive therapy at follow-up were also non-significant. Activity scheduling is an attractive treatment for depression, not only because it is relatively uncomplicated, time-efficient and does not require complex skills from patients or therapist, but also because this meta-analysis found clear indications that it is effective.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: A variety of psychological interventions to treat depressive disorders have been developed and are used in primary care. In a systematic review, we compared the effectiveness of psychological treatments grouped by theoretical background, intensity of contact with the health care professional, and delivery mode for depressed patients in this setting. METHODS: Randomized trials comparing a psychological treatment with usual care, placebo, another psychological treatment, pharmacotherapy, or a combination treatment in adult depressed primary care patients were identified by database searches up to December 2013. We performed both conventional pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis combining direct and indirect evidence. Outcome measures were response to treatment (primary outcome), remission of symptoms, post-treatment depression scores and study discontinuation. RESULTS: A total of 37 studies with 7,024 patients met the inclusion criteria. Among the psychological treatments investigated in at least 150 patients face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; OR 1.80; 95 {\%} credible interval 1.35-2.39), face-to-face counselling and psychoeducation (1.65; 1.27-2.13), remote therapist lead CBT (1.87; 1.38-2.53), guided self-help CBT (1.68; 1.22-2.30) and no/minimal contact CBT (1.53; 1.07-2.17) were superior to usual care or placebo, but not face-to-face problem-solving therapy and face-to-face interpersonal therapy. There were no statistical differences between psychological treatments apart from face-to-face interpersonal psychotherapy being inferior to remote therapist-lead CBT (0.60; 0.37-0.95). Remote therapist-led (0.86; 0.21-3.67), guided self-help (0.93; 0.62-1.41) and no/minimal contact CBT (0.85; 0.54-1.36) had similar effects as face-to-face CBT. CONCLUSIONS: The limited available evidence precludes a sufficiently reliable assessment of the comparative effectiveness of psychological treatments in depressed primary care patients. Findings suggest that psychological interventions with a cognitive behavioral approach are promising, and primarily indirect evidence indicates that it applies also when they are delivered with a reduced number of therapist contacts or remotely.

abstract = "Background
Depression being a prevalent psychobiological disorder across the world, there is a need to identify effective, evidence-based treatments that are time and cost-effective in an effort to increase the population's accessibility to treatments. Low-intensity interventions, such as guided self-help treatments, hold promise for the dissemination of evidence-based treatments. Behavioural activation, a component of cognitive-behavioural therapy, is receiving increasing attention and empirical support as a stand-alone psychological treatment for depression. This article reviews behavioural activation's theoretical foundations and efficacy in light of determining its potential as a low-intensity intervention.
Method
A systematic review of articles on low-intensity behavioural activation interventions for depression was conducted using the PsychInfo, Medline and Embase databases. Behavioural activation's potential for dissemination as a guided self-help treatment is discussed and future avenues of research are stressed.
Limitations
Studies on the efficacy of behavioural activation as a guided self-help treatment are very limited to date and there are significant variations among existing studies.
Conclusions
Based on the research literature, it can be concluded that behavioural activation could be a viable option as a low-intensity guided self-help psychological treatment for mild to moderate depression. Further research is required to better understand the optimal parameters and client–therapist characteristics of this form of low-intensity intervention."

abstract={Antidepressant medication is considered the current standard for severe depression, and cognitive therapy is the most widely investigated psychosocial treatment for depression. However, not all patients want to take medication, and cognitive therapy has not demonstrated consistent efficacy across trials. Moreover, dismantling designs have suggested that behavioral components may account for the efficacy of cognitive therapy. The present study tested the efficacy of behavioral activation by comparing it with cognitive therapy and antidepressant medication in a randomized placebo-controlled design in adults with major depressive disorder (N = 241). In addition, it examined the importance of initial severity as a moderator of treatment outcome. Among more severely depressed patients, behavioral activation was comparable to antidepressant medication, and both significantly outperformed cognitive therapy. The implications of these findings for the evaluation of current treatment guidelines and dissemination are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

SMIs such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are characterized by fluctuating symptoms and sudden relapse. Currently, monitoring of people with an SMI is largely done through face-to-face visits. Smartphone-based geolocation sensors create opportunities for continuous monitoring and early intervention.We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus by combining terms related to geolocation and smartphones with SMI concepts. Study selection and data extraction were done in duplicate.Eighteen publications describing 16 studies were included in our review. Eleven studies focused on bipolar disorder. Common geolocation-derived digital biomarkers were number of locations visited (n = 8), distance traveled (n = 8), time spent at prespecified locations (n = 7), and number of changes in GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) cell (n = 4). Twelve of 14 publications evaluating clinical aspects found an association between geolocation-derived digital biomarker and SMI concepts, especially mood. Geolocation-derived digital biomarkers were more strongly associated with SMI concepts than other information (eg, accelerometer data, smartphone activity, self-reported symptoms). However, small sample sizes and short follow-up warrant cautious interpretation of these findings: of all included studies, 7 had a sample of fewer than 10 patients and 11 had a duration shorter than 12 weeks.The growing body of evidence for the association between SMI concepts and geolocation-derived digital biomarkers shows potential for this instrument to be used for continuous monitoring of patients in their everyday lives, but there is a need for larger studies with longer follow-up times.}",

abstract="Background: Patient retrospective recollection is a mainstay of assessing symptoms in mental health and psychiatry. However, evidence suggests that these retrospective recollections may not be as accurate as data collection though the experience sampling method (ESM), which captures patient data in ``real time'' and ``real life.'' However, the difficulties in practical implementation of ESM data collection have limited its impact in psychiatry and mental health. Smartphones with the capability to run mobile applications may offer a novel method of collecting ESM data that may represent a practical and feasible tool for mental health and psychiatry. Objective: This paper aims to provide data on psychiatric patients' prevalence of smartphone ownership, patterns of use, and interest in utilizing mobile applications to monitor their mental health conditions. Methods: One hundred psychiatric outpatients at a large urban teaching hospital completed a paper-and-pencil survey regarding smartphone ownership, use, and interest in utilizing mobile applications to monitor their mental health condition. Results: Ninety-seven percent of patients reported owning a phone and 72{\%} reported that their phone was a smartphone. Patients in all age groups indicated greater than 50{\%} interest in using a mobile application on a daily basis to monitor their mental health condition. Conclusions: Smartphone and mobile applications represent a practical opportunity to explore new modalities of monitoring, treatment, and research of psychiatric and mental health conditions. ",

    abstract = { Objective:Currently, the diagnosis in bipolar disorder relies on patient information and careful clinical evaluations and judgements with a lack of objective tests. Core clinical features of bipolar disorder include changes in behaviour. We aimed to investigate objective smartphone data reflecting behavioural activities to classify patients with bipolar disorder compared with healthy individuals.Methods:Objective smartphone data were automatically collected from 29 patients with bipolar disorder and 37 healthy individuals. Repeated measurements of objective smartphone data were performed during different affective states in patients with bipolar disorder over 12 weeks and compared with healthy individuals.Results:Overall, the sensitivity of objective smartphone data in patients with bipolar disorder versus healthy individuals was 0.92, specificity 0.39, positive predictive value 0.88 and negative predictive value 0.52. In euthymic patients versus healthy individuals, the sensitivity was 0.90, specificity 0.56, positive predictive value 0.85 and negative predictive value 0.67. In mixed models, automatically generated objective smartphone data (the number of text messages/day, the duration of phone calls/day) were increased in patients with bipolar disorder (during euthymia, depressive and manic or mixed states, and overall) compared with healthy individuals. The amount of time the smartphone screen was ‘on’ per day was decreased in patients with bipolar disorder (during euthymia, depressive state and overall) compared with healthy individuals.Conclusion:Objective smartphone data may represent a potential diagnostic behavioural marker in bipolar disorder and may be a candidate supplementary method to the diagnostic process in the future. Further studies including larger samples, first-degree relatives and patients with other psychiatric disorders are needed. }
