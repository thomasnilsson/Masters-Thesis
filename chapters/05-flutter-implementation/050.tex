The final product allows the programmer to compute mobility features with the following 3 lines of code displayed in Figure \ref{fig:code-example-intro}. This chapter will describe how the package design described in Chapter \ref{chapter:04} was implemented in Flutter such that this succinct code interface was achieved.  The Flutter source code for this thesis can be found at \url{https://github.com/thomasnilsson/msc-thesis-flutter}.
