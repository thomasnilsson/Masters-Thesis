\chapter{Flutter Implementation}
\label{chapter:05}
The final version of the package allows the programmer to compute mobility features with the 3 lines of code displayed in Figure \ref{fig:code-example-intro}. This chapter will describe how the package design described in Chapter \ref{chapter:04} was implemented in Flutter such this programming interface was achieved. The Flutter, and Python source code for this thesis can be found at \url{https://github.com/thomasnilsson/mobility-features-thesis}.
