\chapter{API and App Implementation}
\label{chapter:05-api-implementation}
This chapter will describe how the API was developed alongside a mobile Flutter app which used the package. The Flutter app was used to conduct a study which is described in Chapter ??. By developing the two alongside each-other, a synergistic development process was made in which lessons were learned both ways. Firstly it will be discussed how the application was set up and what it set out to do, and afterwards it will be laid out how the API accommodated these requirements.
