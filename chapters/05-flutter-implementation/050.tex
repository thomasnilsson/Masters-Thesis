The final product allows the programmer to compute mobility features with the following 3 lines of code displayed in Figure \ref{fig:code-example-intro}. This chapter will describe how the package design described in Chapter \ref{chapter:04} was implemented in Flutter such that this succinct code interface was achieved.

    \begin{minted}{dart}
    /// Collect data with a location plugin
    List<LocationSample> locationSamples = ///

    /// Store data via the package
    await ContextGenerator.saveSamples(locationSamples);
    
    /// Compute Features via the package
    MobilityContext context = await ContextGenerator.generate();
