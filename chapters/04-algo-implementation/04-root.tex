\chapter{Algorithm Implementation}
This chapter deals with the implementation-specific details of the algorithms. Specifically the chapter will discuss how the intermediate features and main features are implemented such that they can be evaluated in a smart-phone environment. This is important because it cannot be taken for granted that data can be stored without thinking of how to do this in a smart manner. In addition many of the features cannot be directly implemented according to their mathematical definition provided in Chapter \ref{chapter:03-design}. This is due to Dart being an imperative programming language which does not support mathematical and vector notation, such as is the case with scripting language such as Python and MATLAB.
