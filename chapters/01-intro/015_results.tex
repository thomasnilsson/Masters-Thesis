\section{Results}
The Mobility Features Package was implemented in the Flutter framework and published\footnote{\url{https://pub.dev/packages/mobility_features}}. Through the package, an application programmer can compute mobility features with just 3 lines of code. From the work of Saeb et al. \cite{Saeb2015}, Canzian et al. \cite{Canzian2015} the features \textit{Home Stay, Number of Places, Distance Travelled, Location Variance, Entropy, Normalized Entropy,} and \textit{Routine Index} were chosen to be included in the package. A set of additional features: \textit{Stops}, \textit{Places} and \textit{Moves}, were included as well, inspired by the work of Cuttone et al. \cite{sparse-location-2014} and Canzian et al. \cite{Canzian2015}. Features are computed in real-time using historical Stops and Moves stored on the phone which lowers the storage requirements greatly compared to using raw location data for feature computation.\\

The package does not depend on any specific location plugin due to its design, which allows the programmer to flexibly choose their plugin for tracking location data. Being independent of any specific location plugin enables easier maintenance and allows the package to be used among other packages dependent on location tracking, without causing dependency issues. Through a field study with 10 participants, the capabilities of the package were demonstrated. For this study, a Flutter application collected the participants' location for 3 weeks and used the package to compute the participants' features multiple times daily. Participants also filled out a daily questionnaire about the features, which were compared to the computed features. In the 3-week study, the following insights concerning the Mobility Features Package were drawn:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Mobility Features Packages successfully allowed mobility features to be computed several times a day. However, non-uniform gaps were observed in the collected location data, reducing the accuracy of the computed features. 
    
    \item When comparing the daily features with subjective user data we found that the Mobility Features Package computes the Number of Places visited with an RMSE of 0.5 places, the Home Stay percentage with an RMSE of 14.3\% and the Routine Index with an RMSE of 22.5\%.
    
    \item The algorithms tend to undershoot in predicting the Number of Places and Home Stay, which is likely due to gaps in the collected data. There is no consistent over- or undershooting shown when it comes to computing the Routine Index. This likely stems from the between-subject variance in the routine answers as well as the gaps in the location data.
\end{itemize}

The thesis lastly discusses different approaches to mitigate the errors in computing features, i.e. how the algorithms can be improved and how gaps in the data can be handled in the future.
