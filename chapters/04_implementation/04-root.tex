\chapter{Implementation}
This chapter deals with the implementation-specific details, in which programming paradigms, algorithms, and architectures used will be discussed. Specifically the chapter will discuss how the pre-processing is implemented in an object-oriented, imperative fashion, how features are extracted from the pre-processing features, and how this is achieved in a continuous fashion, on the device.
