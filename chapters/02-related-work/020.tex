Providing a software package for computing mobility features is a novel idea which we have not found mentioned in the existing literature. What does exist however are contributions describing how digital phenotyping can be used within psychotherapy, as well contributions describing how a user state used for phenotyping can be inferred from location data. Lastly there does also exist software framework which have the aim of making it easy for an application programmer to compute features used for digital phenotyping. The work of this thesis lies somewhere in between these contributions.
