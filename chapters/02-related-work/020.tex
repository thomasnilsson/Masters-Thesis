Providing a software package for computing mobility features is a novel idea which does not exist in the literature. What does exist however are contributions describing how a user state used for phenotyping can be inferred from location data as well as contributions describing mobile sensing frameworks for digital phenotyping. The work of this thesis lies somewhere in between these two topics.
