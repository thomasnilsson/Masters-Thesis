Providing a software package for computing mobility features is a novel idea which we have not found mentioned in the existing literature. What does exist however are contributions describing how a user state used for phenotyping can be inferred from location data as well as contributions within software framework development for digital phenotyping. The work of this thesis lies somewhere in between these two topics.
