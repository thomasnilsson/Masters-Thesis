\label{chapter:06}
To validate the Mobility Features Package in a real world setting, a small-scale field study was conducted in which 10 participants were tracked over 3 weeks. For this study a mobile application was developed in Flutter that used the package to compute features on a daily basis. Subjective user-data also collected through the application in the form of a small questionnaire. This chapter will go through the choices made in developing the app and conducting the study.
