\section{Activity Recognition using Cell Phone Accelerometers}

% Smartphones are equipped with increasingly sophisticated and accurate sensors such as accelerometers and GPS trackers, and are increasingly becoming more and more available to consumers. This creates new opportunities for data mining and applications using the collected user data and this paper describes how accelerometers embedded in smart-phones can be used to perform activity recognition. A system which uses the accelerometer to perform activity recognition is described. Activity recognition is the art of inferring the userâ€™s physical state, such as running, standing, or sitting. This can be used to customize a user experience, but also in medical contexts to detect if people are doing a sufficient amount of exercise.
