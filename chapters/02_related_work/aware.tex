\section{AWARE: Mobile Context Instrumentation Framework [2015]}
The AWARE Framework \cite{aware2015} is an open source toolkit and a reusable platform for capturing, inferring and generating context on mobile devices. Today, phones are full of sensors but constrained on resources such as compute power and especially battery, and this has to be considered when generating  context in real time using the phone battery. AWARE aims to ensure an easy way of collection contexts for the application developer, and it is demonstrated how the tool can can reduce the software development effort of researchers when building mobile tools for devleoping context-aware apps and doing so with minimal battery impact. By concealing and encapsulating the underlying implementation of sensor data-retrieval and exposing the inferred context as a higher level abstraction, AWARE shifts the focus from software development to data collection and analysis. This opens the research field to be less programming oriented. Currently AWARE is available on both iOS and Android and supports a number of data channels \footnote{\url{https://awareframework.com/sensors/}} such as the built-in sensors, as well as Application usage, SMS- and call-logs. Some of the channels are however not available on iOS due to the iOS API in general being more restrictive than that of the Android SDK.
