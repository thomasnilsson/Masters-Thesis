\section{AWARE: Mobile Context Instrumentation Framework}
The \textit{AWARE Framework} \cite{aware2015} is an open-source toolkit and a reusable platform for capturing, inferring, and generating user-contexts on mobile devices. Phones possess high-quality sensors but are resource-constrained with regards to their processing speed and battery capacity, which must be considered when computing contexts in real-time. The \textit{AWARE Framework} therefore aims to ensure an easy way of collection contexts for the application developer, and it is demonstrated how the tool can reduce the software development effort of researchers when building mobile tools for developing context-aware apps and doing so with minimal battery impact. By designing an API that conceals the underlying implementation of sensor data-retrieval, and exposes an abstract representation of a \textit{user context object}, AWARE shifts the focus from software development to data collection and analysis. Currently AWARE is available on both iOS and Android and supports a number of data channels \footnote{\url{https://awareframework.com/sensors/}} such as the built-in sensors, as well as \textit{Application Usage}, \textit{SMS}, and \textit{Phone Call Logs}. Some of the channels are however not available on iOS due to the iOS developer API, in general, being more restrictive than that of its Android counterpart.
