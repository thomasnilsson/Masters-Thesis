\chapter{Related Work}
This chapter will describe what work has been done within treatment of depression related to digital phenotyping and context generation. Secondly, a series of previous contributions will be presented which deal with computing mobility features including how these features can be used in a medical context. Thirdly, a brief insight into exisiting mobile sensing frameworks will be given, including how the \textit{Mobility Features Package} will fit into one of these frameworks. Lastly, an example of a recommender system is given for which the \textit{Mobility Features Package} is an ideal use case.

% 1 Show you know the literature
% there is far too much literature for you to be exhaustive, so you must be selective
% 2 Gives your readers background to understand your work
% this includes both readers who are specialists in your area, and readers who know nothing about it (e.g., external examiners). Its a delicate balancing act
% 3 Gives a historical perspective
% shows how ideas arose and evolved over time
% 4 Leads into the problem you wish to tackle in your thesis
% what others have done before within this context, what is being done now, what problems have been identified, what has not been worked on, how your own work builds / adds onto this
% 5 Describes related work
% illustrates other ideas related to your research idea i.e., how they are in common and how they are different
% explains why your idea or perspective is new
% 6 Gives a new view of the problem / solution space
% 7 Synthesis: combines together the literature in a way that adds something new i.e., the whole is greater than the sum of the parts
% birds eye view: as a reader of the literature, you now have a better perspective than any individual author may have had (particularly earlier authors who have not seen later work). You can now 'step back' and give a coherent overview of all that has happened
% framework: fits all the pieces together into an organization that relates all the parts
