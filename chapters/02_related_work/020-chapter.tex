\chapter{Related Work}

This chapter will describe firstly what work has been done within treatment of depression and how this work relates to digital phenotyping and context generation. Secondly it will explore which previous contributions exist which deal with generating contexts and computing mobility features, including the algorithms for doing so, and how they relate to the medical standards such as the PHQ-9 questionnaire \ref{appendix:questionnaires}. Lastly it will be described which efforts have been made in within mobile sensing to standardize data collection and context generation in a more general sense, and how the \textit{Mobility Features Package} will fit into this ecosystem.

% 1 Show you know the literature
% there is far too much literature for you to be exhaustive, so you must be selective
% 2 Gives your readers background to understand your work
% this includes both readers who are specialists in your area, and readers who know nothing about it (e.g., external examiners). Its a delicate balancing act
% 3 Gives a historical perspective
% shows how ideas arose and evolved over time
% 4 Leads into the problem you wish to tackle in your thesis
% what others have done before within this context, what is being done now, what problems have been identified, what has not been worked on, how your own work builds / adds onto this
% 5 Describes related work
% illustrates other ideas related to your research idea i.e., how they are in common and how they are different
% explains why your idea or perspective is new
% 6 Gives a new view of the problem / solution space
% 7 Synthesis: combines together the literature in a way that adds something new i.e., the whole is greater than the sum of the parts
% birds eye view: as a reader of the literature, you now have a better perspective than any individual author may have had (particularly earlier authors who have not seen later work). You can now 'step back' and give a coherent overview of all that has happened
% framework: fits all the pieces together into an organization that relates all the parts
