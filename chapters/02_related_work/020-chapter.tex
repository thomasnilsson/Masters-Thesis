This chapter will describe what work has been done within the treatment of depression related to digital phenotyping and context generation. Secondly, a series of previous contributions will be presented which deal with computing mobility features including how these features can be used in a medical context. Thirdly, a brief insight into existing mobile sensing frameworks will be given, including how the \textit{Mobility Features Package} will fit into one of these frameworks. Lastly, an example of a recommender system is given for which the \textit{Mobility Features Package} is an ideal use case.
