\section{Data Analysis of Study}
As discussed, the participants had to fill out a small questionnaire every day in the evening and these answers were then matched against the computed results. The study resulted in a dataset with 205 days of data, corresponding to 2.51M timestamped location data points, spread over 10 participants. Table \ref{tab:location-samples} shows the overview of the data collected for each participant, including the number of points, number of days and the storage requirements for the collected data.\\

Similar to Cuttone et al. \cite{sparse-location-2014}, the participants have been anonymized as \textit{P1} through \textit{P9}, and the author has been marked as \textit{R} (researcher).\\

\end{table}

The answers were of a different format than the computed features and therefore had to be transformed such that they could be directly compared. For the Home Stay feature, the answer the users gave was the number of \textit{hours away from home}, at the time of registering. For calculating the Home Stay value from a given answer $a$ given at the timestamp $t$ equation \ref{eq:home-stay-ans} was applied:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:home-stay-ans}
    h = \frac{t - a }{t}
\end{equation}

For the \textit{Routine Index}, the answer (a number between 0 to 5) was transformed to scalar between 0 and 1, by dividing the answer value $s$ by the maximum, 5 i.e:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:routine-ans}
    r = \frac{s}{5}
\end{equation}

Regarding data collection, figure \ref{fig:plot-num-points-stops} displays how much data was collected per participant. From this figure, it is clear that some participants did not collect nearly as much data as others, and because of this their computed features are expected to be more inaccurate. It was also discovered that the number of stops found is not necessarily correlated with the number of location samples found, as can be seen for participant P7. This can be due to reasons such as moving around much less, which results in fewer but stops with a longer duration being found. The average size of a serialized LocationSample object was computed based on file size to be around 100 bytes, and serialized a Stop was 140 bytes.\\  \\

\subsection{Missing Location Data and Answers}
The sampling was set to once per second, yet data was not sampled uniformly. In fact, there were many gaps in the collected data. Figure \ref{fig:plot-gaps-data} shows the data of the author collected during the study over 24 days. The author had a relatively new phone (iPhone XS) and was diligent in making sure the phone was tracking the location as often as possible, yet still has significant gaps in his data. This means other participants that were less diligent or had older phones have even more gaps is still missing in certain periods. These gaps are consistent in the morning where the phone is not moving around, but after 6 AM it seems there is no pattern for the gaps. The event plot for the collected data for the diligent participant P8 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:p8-gaps} in Appendix \ref{appendix:data-analysis}. \\

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/study/thomas-gaps.png}
    \caption{An event plot for the author's sampled location data, each day of the study. As can be seen there are quite a few gaps in the data which will make the computes features less accurate}
    \label{fig:plot-gaps-data}
\end{figure}

Regarding the subjective user data, many users missed filling out the diary on several days. Figure \ref{fig:plot-days-answered} shows the number of total days where a participant participated in the study against the days on which they provided an answer. It was only possible to calculate the error between computed features and the answers on day, if the participant gave an answer. This means that for some participants, a lot of data was thrown away for the data analysis. As an example, it was considered whether or not to entirely get rid of P9 since he/she has very little data both terms of total days collected and even fewer in terms of days with answers. \\

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/study/storage/answers_days_plot.png}
    \caption{The total number of days of participation vs the days for which the diary was filled out by the participant. As can be seen, some users often forgot to give an answer}
    \label{fig:plot-days-answered}
\end{figure}

Another problem that was encountered was when participants would fill out the questionnaire during the night, or the very next morning due to forgetting the previous evening. This meant the answer for day $n$ would be listed as date $n+1$, i.e. the wrong date.  In addition, some users entirely forgot certain days but remembered it the following day, and reported it manually to the researcher, and these answers were then added manually. These issues were rectified by changing all answers given between 00:00 and 10:00 to the previous date at 23:59:59.

\subsection{Feature Evaluation}
The Home Stay feature required the participant to track their location during the night, as previously mentioned. This meant that if they did not, the Home Stay feature could not be evaluated for that particular day, however other features might still be available for computation, such as the Number of Places. This meant that the number of days for which a given feature can be compared to the answers is not necessarily the same for all features. \\

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/study/homestay_valid_days.png}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/study/numplaces_valid_days.png}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/study/routine_valid_days.png}
    \caption{The days for which a given feature could be evaluated, out of the total days for which an answer was given and features were computed. As can be seen from the top plot, participant P4 had very few days where the home stay could be computed in comparison to the total number of days tracked which are above 20}
    \label{fig:plot-daily}
\end{figure}

The Home Stay feature is calculated by using the \textit{tracked} time at home, divided by the total time elapsed since midnight, and therefore a small gap in the data will make the feature undershoot. It is therefore to be expected that this feature will lie somewhat lower than the answer given by the user since there will be gaps in the data. \\

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/study/places_d6b2d9b9-398b-4e0d-b52b-224747f515c8.png}

    \caption{The answered and calculated data for each day, for the author}
    \label{fig:plot-author-features}
\end{figure}

The day-by-day results for the author are displayed in figure \ref{fig:plot-daily} and from this plot, the computed features have a high correspondence with the provided answers. However, the feature computation for the author is biased since he knew how the parameters of the algorithms. It is therefore relevant to show another participant, namely participant P8, who was very diligent in answering and tracking their location data. For this participant, very promising results were also produced which can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:plot-p8-features}.

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}


\subsection{Measuring Errors}
A thing to keep in mind when comparing user answers to computed features is that the participants' answers are not ground truth, and there are multiple reasons why a participant's answer may be inaccurate. People's subjective recollection is not necessarily as accurate as they think it might me. Also, it was not communicated explicitly to the participants what exactly counts as a place, and how their 'routine' is calculated. This means that participants may have filled out the questionnaire differently. Lastly, the routine scale answer was very course-grained, and therefore the participants were probably rarely able to provide an exact answer, according to their own recollection. As such, there are a few ways \textit{data errors} may occur:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The computed feature can be wrong due to gaps in the data (\textit{data collection error})
    \item The subjective answer from the user is wrong, e.g. if they misunderstood the concept of the question (\textit{answer error})
    \item Both of a \textit{data collection error} and an \textit{answer error} are made at the same time
\end{itemize}

The RMSE was computed for all three features across participants is shown in Table \ref{tab:error-table}. We observe the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Number of Places features deviates with almost 1 place daily, compared the subjective answers.

    \item The Home Stay percentage deviates with 14\% daily, compared the subjective answers.

    \item The Routine Index deviates with 22.5\% daily, compared the subjective answers. Note that the Routine Index answer was given on scale with 20 \% increments, as such an RMSE of 22.5\% is equivalent to one step on the scale.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
    \hline
                        & \textbf{Number of Places} & \textbf{Home Stay} & \textbf{Routine Index} \\ \hline
    \textbf{Mean RMSE}       & 0.99                      & 14.27 (\%)         & 22.5 (\%)              \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{The mean RMSE computed for all participants}
    \label{tab:error-table}
\end{table}


To say something about whether or not the features undershoot or overshoot, the mean error was calculated for each participant as as $ME = \frac{\sum f - \sum a}{N}$ where $f$ is a vector of the computed feature values, and $a$ is a vector the answer value. $N$ is the total number of days for which the specific feature could be evaluate for that participant. If the mean error is positive it means the feature overshoots compared to the answered value, and vice versa if the error is negative. Since the mean error has a sign the values would be cancelling each other out and therefore the 'mean' mean error cannot be computed. Instead, the individual mean error for each participant is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:plot-mean-error}. From this figure we observe the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Number of Places feature undershoots by around 0.6 places or lower for most participants, with P7 being an outlier with -1.5 places. It is likely that the undershooting stems from \textit{data collection errors}, which can lead to places not being detected.

    \item The Home Stay feature undershoots for 8/10 participants, most of these having an error under 10\%. For those two participants where the feature overshoots, the error is also within 10\%. It is highly likely that it undershoots for the majority of the users due to \textit{data collection errors} leading to an underestimation of the time spent at home.

    \item The Routine Index feature has an equal number of participants for which it overshoots and undershoots. The current implementation of the feature will ignore time-slots for which data is missing, which leads to the Routine Index overshooting if a lot of data is missing. This feature is likely affected both by \textit{data collection errors} as well as \textit{answer errors}, hence the varying results.
