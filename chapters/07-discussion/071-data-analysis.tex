\section{Data Analysis of Study}
As discussed, the participants had to fill out a small questionnaire every day in the evening and these answers were then matched against the computed results. The study resulted in a dataset with 205 days of data, corresponding to 2.51M timestamped location data points, spread over 10 participants.

\subsection{Calculating the Answers}
The answers had to be converted into scalars such that they could be compared directly to the computed features. 

In any case the feature calculation closest to the answer was used, prioritising a features calculated after the given answer, rather than earlier. For the Home Stay feature, the time at which the answer was sent is used for calculating the elapsed time. If the user is away from home at the time of answering, they will likely taken this into account. It is assumed however that most people would wait until they were at home before registering. For the \textit{Routine Index}, the answer (a number of 0 to 5) was transformed to scalar between 0 and 1, i.e. let the scale value be $s \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$, then the corresponding \textit{Routine Index} is calculated as 

\begin{equation}
    r = \frac{s}{s_{max}}, \quad s_{max} = 5
\end{equation}

\subsection{Error Measuring}
Regarding data collection, figure \ref{fig:plot-num-points-stops} displays how much data was collected per participant which gives an indication of how much could be computed. It also became clear that some participants did not collect nearly as much data as others, and because of this their results are expected to be worse. The number of stops found are not necessarily correlated with the number of points found, as can be seen for participant P7. This can be due to reasons such as moving around much less, which results in fewer, but Stops with a longer duration being found.

    \caption{The ratio between Location Samples and Stops expressed in terms of storage, in MB}
    \label{fig:plot-num-points-stops}
\end{figure}

With the size of a serialized \textit{LocationSample} is 100 bytes, and a \textit{Stop} being 139 bytes, it is possible to calculate the compression rate for each participant, i.e. how much their dataset was reduced by converting Location Samples into Stops. However this will inevitably vary to a potential large degree from participant to participant, due to the number of stops per  varying a lot.

The day-by-day results for the author are displayed in figure \ref{fig:plot-daily}.

The number of valid days for a specific feature is a day for which the user gave answers, and the feature could be calculated. If the user for example turned off their phone during the night, the home stay feature could not be calculated, but the routine index feature and the number of places will likely still have been calculated.


\subsection{Subjectivity of Answers and Ground Truth}
A thing to keep in mind is that the participants' answers are not ground truth, and there are multiple reasons why a participants answer may be inaccurate. Firstly, people's subjective recollection is not necessarily as accurate as they think it might me. Secondly, it was not communicated explicitly to the participants what exactly counts as a place, and how their 'routine' is calculated - this means that participants may have filled out the questionnaire differently, given the same ground truth data - for example whether or not being in the garden counts as being home. Secondly, some users misunderstood the routine scale and users whose data looked strange were contacted afterwards to enquire about whether they had misunderstood the question and if so the answers were corrected as much as could be done. Lastly, the hour away from home and routine index answers were very course grained, and therefore the participants were probably rarely able to give exact answers, according to the their own recollection. 

\subsection{Missing Data and Correcting Data}
Some users missed several days of filling out the diary which meant the computed features for that day could not be compared to a subjective measurement. Figure \ref{fig:plot-days-answered} shows the number of total days where a participant participated in the study where data was collected vs the days on which they provided an answer. For data analysis it was only possible to calculate the error between computed features and the answers given if the participant actually gave an answer. This mean that for some participants, a lot of data was unfortunately not usable for the data analysis. As an example, it was considered whether or not to entirely get rid of P9 since he or she has very little data both terms of total days collected and even fewer in terms of days with answers. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/study/storage/answers_days_plot.png}
    \caption{The total number of days of participation vs the days for which the diary was filled out by the participant. As can be seen, some users often forgot to give an answer}
    \label{fig:plot-days-answered}
\end{figure}

Another problem which was encountered was when participants would fill out the questionnaire for day $n$ during the night, which mean the resulting date was $n+1$, i.e. the wrong date. This was simple enough to fix by simply moving all answers given between 00:00 and 10:00 to the previous date which got rid of all the problematic data points. In addition some users entirely forgot certain days but remembered it the following day, and reported it manually to the researcher, and these data points were then added manually. 

\subsection{Feature Evaluation}
The Home Stay feature required the participant to track their location during the night, as previously mentioned. This meant that if they did not, the Home Stay feature could not be evaluated for that particular day, however other features might still be available for computation, such as the Number of Places. This meant that the number of days for which a given feature can be compared to the answers is not necessarily the same for all features. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[0.5\textwidth]{images/study/homestay_valid_days.png}

    \caption{The days for which a given feature could be evaluated, out of the total days for which an answer was given and features were computed}
    \label{fig:plot-daily}
\end{figure}

Since the Home Stay feature is calculated by using the \textit{tracked} time at home, divided by the total time time midnight, it only takes a few minutes of missing data to make the home stay feature undershoot. It is therefore to be expected that this feature will lie somewhat lower than the answer given by the user, given the user did not round up excessively.


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[0.5\textwidth]{images/study/places_d6b2d9b9-398b-4e0d-b52b-224747f515c8.png}

    \caption{The answered and calculated data for each day, for the author}
    \label{fig:plot-author-features}
\end{figure}

However, the author did know how the features were calculated and as such it was hard to refrain from using this information when filling out the questionnaire. Therefore it is relevant to show participant P8 who was very committed to filling out and making sure the phone was tracking. For this participant, very promising results were also produced.

\begin{figure}

    \label{fig:plot-participant-features}
\end{figure}


To say something about whether or not the algorithms undershoots or overshoots, the difference in sum was calculated as $ME = \frac{\sum(A) - \sum(F)}{N}$ ($N$ being the total number of days for the specific feature) meaning that if the result is positive then the answered result was on average higher and vice versa if the result is negative. The alternative is to calculate the mean error one can also calculate the mean of the difference per observation $ME = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N} (a_i - f_i)$ however this the downside of cancelling out certain observations when the sign differs. 

The users generally answer that they have been at more places than the algorithms calculate.

Home stay generally predicts 10\% lower for half the participants, which was to be expected. Although for a couple of participants it predicts higher (i.e. negative mean error) although still within 10\% error. For participant 2 however it averages out to zero percent and for participant 1 the algorithms predict lower and has an error of 30\%.

The routine index is a mixed bag, with 6 participants answering higher than the algorithm and the remaining 4 being lower. All except for participant 6 deviating with almost 40\%. An important detail here is that the routine index was answered in increments of 20\% meaning that if a larger study was conducted in which the scale was more fine-grained, i.e. from 0 to 10 instead, it is possible the answers would be a lot closer to the predictions
