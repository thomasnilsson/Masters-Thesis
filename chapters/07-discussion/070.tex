Calculate routine index from week to week rather than day to day. Currently we assume that all days ideally look identical, which for most people will not be the case. For many people the weekends differ quite a lot from their every day, and naturally the routine index will therefore be lower during the weekend, and weekend days will tend to 'wash out' the routine index calculation.
