\section{Field Study}
A small-scale study was conducted which included 10 participants, including the author. Corona crisis made it uncommon for people to move around a lot and most of the time was spent at home. This was not optimal conditions for testing the algorithms, but not impossible at all.

\subsection{Data Storage}
While development of the application was still on-going the data collected on the phone had to be stored somewhere online in order to verify the output of the algorithms run in Python as well as on the phone. For this a FireBase file storage server was used which supports file uploads. A JSON file was uploaded each day, with the upload being triggered manually.
