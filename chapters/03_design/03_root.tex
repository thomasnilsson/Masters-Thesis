\chapter{Design}
This chapter will discuss, the requirements for the software package. Firstly a brief overview of the technology used will be given, this includes GPS data, and an architecture overview. Next it will be discussed which features should be computed in order to produce a useful mobility context, and how some these algorithms can be designed to work in real-time. Thirdly, the underlying data model design is discussed which has implications for how the information flow of the implementation looks like. Lastly the philosophy of design of the public-facing API will be discussed.
