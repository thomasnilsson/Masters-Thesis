\chapter{Design}
\label{chapter:03-design}
This chapter will discuss, the requirements for the software package. Firstly, a brief overview of the technology used will be given, this includes GPS data and an architecture overview. Next it will be discussed which features should be computed to produce a useful mobility context, and how some of these algorithms can be designed to work in real-time. Thirdly, the underlying data model design is discussed which has implications for how the information flow of the implementation looks like. Lastly the philosophy of design of the public-facing API will be discussed.
