\subsection{Tracking Location Data}
Location data sampled on a mobile device contains information such as the geospatial position on the globe, as well as a time-stamp. Location data may also include information such as altitude, accuracy, and speed, but these attributes were not considered. Tracking location data on a smartphone on Android or iOS works by calling a Location API that allows the streaming of location data. The location data should be tracked in the background since the user cannot be expected to not use their phone at all during the time they are being tracked since this is virtual all the time. For this to work, certain permissions and flags must be configured correctly on the respective platforms such that the application using this package can sample location data and process it in the background. Shortly after the start of this thesis, Google limited how the Android Location API handles background updates, which meant that an Android application must be in the foreground to track location such as is the case with Google Maps navigation where it is very explicit\footnote{\url{https://developer.android.com/training/location/background}}. Due to time constraints however, a good solution to this problem was not found.

\subsection{Flutter Plugins and Packages}
The Flutter Framework is a cross-platform development framework that was released by Google in 2018. Flutter uses the Dart programming language and makes it possible to write a codebase purely in Dart, and compiling this code to native iOS and Android code. What this means is that an application developer can create an application for both platforms with a single codebase. However whenever native-specific APIs have to be invoked such as that of the camera or various phone-sensors, a package developer has to write a library that does so, by means of a method invocation from the Dart language which triggers the corresponding API invocation ob the Android or iOS platform. This method invocation library is referred to as a \textit{plugin} within the Flutter world, in contrast to a \textit{package} which simply invokes other Dart code and as such contains no platform-specific source code. The \textit{Mobility Features Package} will be a Flutter package that contains a collection of algorithms that provides an application programmer with object-oriented abstractions that allows him/her to calculate relevant features for a mobile health application. The Location API, available on both iOS and Android, will not be invoked directly from this package since that would require it to be a plugin. This has two main upsides: From the point of the application developer, it allows him/her to use their location plugin of choice (of which there are many \footnote{\url{https://pub.dev/packages?q=location}} with specific parameters for how the location is tracked (ex frequency and distance). Secondly, from the perspective of the maintainer of this package, the package becomes much more modular and in turn easier to maintain.
